#About Hank Wu

I am a NYU Shanghai that was born and raised to Chinese immigrants in America. Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/logicallyhank).

##My Life Summarized in Bullet Points:
1. I was born in Colorado.
2. Although neither of my parents speak Cantonese, Cantonese was my first language (I learned it from my nanny).
3. My father moved to New York City before my first birthday to work for an investment bank called Citi.
4. I went to a Quaker middle school after attending a public school for elementary school.
5. In high school, I attended a college prepatory boarding school in New Jersey called The Peddie School.
6. In middle school and high school, I ran a technology YouTube channel called [LogicallyHank](http://youtube.com/logicallyhank) but met limited success. However, I am still grateful for the opportunity.
