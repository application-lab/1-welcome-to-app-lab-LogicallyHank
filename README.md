#About Hank Wu

I am a NYU Shanghai student that was born and raised to Chinese immigrants in America. I am particularly interested in technology and how it shapes the world around us. Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/logicallyhank)!

Outside of technology, I am also a huge fan of broadway musicals. I have been fortunate enough to watch many incredible shows in New York including: Hamilton, Wicked, Come From Away, The Lion King, The Phantom of the Opera, Mama Mia, and more! Although I have no concrete interest in exploring this professionally, it is a dream of mine to own a theater on broadway.

In the past, I have had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of companies in many sectors including: government, high finance (banking) technology, and more! I am grateful for these tremendous opportunities in developing myself as a young professional. Thank you for reading!

I have included some random facts about myself below.

##My Life Summarized in Bullet Points:
1. I was born in Colorado.
2. Although neither of my parents speak Cantonese, Cantonese was my first language (I learned it from my nanny).
3. My father moved to New York City before my first birthday to work for an investment bank called Citi.
4. I went to a Quaker middle school after attending a public school for elementary school.
5. In high school, I attended a college prepatory boarding school in New Jersey called The Peddie School.
6. In middle school and high school, I ran a technology YouTube channel called [LogicallyHank](http://youtube.com/logicallyhank) but met limited success. However, I am still grateful for the opportunity.
